# Machine Learning based Genetic Risk Estimation

This repository contains a number of packages and classes I wrote to perform genetic risk esitmation.
It currently contains methods and classes to transform plink files to sample-major format as well as ways to read these binary files efficiently.
In addition it contains PyTorch and TF classes to perform NN and penalized regressions.


This is a work in process repository and not itendent for others.
At least for now.
